# Brickulator, the best Bricksize calculator
Ever wanted to know how many bricks tall your coffe mashine would be in Minifigure Scale? Or wanted to know how many studs wide your build can be whilst still fitting into your shelf? This tool is the solution.

# The magical math of LEGO ðŸ”§
### Lego sizes to real life:
+ 1 stud = 0.8 cm wide
+ 1 brick = 1.15 cm tall
+ 1 plate = 1/3 brick tall
### Real life to Minifigure Scale:
I figured the average human size would be 1.8m, this leads to:
+ 1.8m = 4 Bricks tall
+ 1.8m = 5 studs wide
