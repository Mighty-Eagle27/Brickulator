# Bricksizes-to-real-life-converter
This little html and css package allows you to quickly calculate, how many studs wide and bricks/plates tall something of x meters or centimeters is. Additionally it also allows you to convert reallife sizes into minifigure scale, by just giving it the irl Size and turning it into studs and bricks :D
